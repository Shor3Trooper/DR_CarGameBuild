## Help

If the car is stuck in a loop where it is stuck in the ground and its position is reset,
angle the car vertically then use either W or S to move the car above ground. 
If the car is stuck on either of its sides, or upside down, drive the car into a building to cause the car to clip into the ground. This will cause the loop as stated above, so use the solution above.
